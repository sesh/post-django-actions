This is the example project from my [Deploying Django app with Github Actions and Django Up](https://brntn.me/blog/django-up-actions/) post.

You can check out the [deployment workflow](https://github.com/sesh/post-django-actions/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy.yml) and the [Actions run](https://github.com/sesh/post-django-actions/actions).

And you can view the hosted site here:
